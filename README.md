I am a cse fresher from bits pilani!!

This 3D game is built on unity 3.12.1 for all platforms.
<br>
It has a Wheel as a player in a sci-fi futuristic environment.
I added a limited jump system so that you only have two jumps to add a bit more of gameplay.
The score system is based on the distance covered by you unit hitting an obstacle.
I wanted to add a lot of ideas like a coin-like currency for extra points,better and more diverse obstacles, better background, a rough and slippery patch for added difficulty and a lot more but couldnt due to time constraints and generally my laptop and unity screwing me over a 1000 times.

(yes i work with an iGPU and 8gigs of ram)
